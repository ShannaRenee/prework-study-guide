# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
I created this prework study guide webpage as a place to hold all of the notes that I took while learning basic information about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. This website is interactive and makes it easy for me and others to access the notes I took once I deploy the website. This project was also a way for me to practice the basic tools of these programming languages, so that I could dip my toes and start to gain familiarity with the content that we will be going over in the bootcamp.


## Installation
N/A

## Usage
Each section of notes is clearly marked by a main header so that users can see what topics are covered. If you open the DevTools console you can see the topics and it will also suggest a topic to start studying first. The website is stylized so that each section has its own box to contain the information.
